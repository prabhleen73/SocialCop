Social-Cop – A mobile based solution to address the needs of removal of daily traffic chaos.

Problem: More people die on Indian roads every day than to enemy fire, Maoist attacks or diseases, but here’s how staggering that figure actually is-

5 lakhs road accidents every year.
Claiming the lives of 1.46 lakh citizens annually.
17 deaths an hour
400 per day.
Solution: 
The core idea revolves around providing a mobile based solution such that anyone can easily lodge a complaint against the various causes of traffic chaos:

Traffic Signal Faults.
Illegally Parked Cars.
Accidents.
Potholes, Unstructured Roads.
Road Rage,etc.
